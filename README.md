The ancient Greeks reached the Iberian Peninsula, of which they had heard from the Phoenicians, by voyaging westward on the Mediterranean. Hecataeus of Miletus was the first known to use the term Iberia, which he wrote about c. 500 BCE. Herodotus of Halicarnassus says of the Phocaeans that "it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with the iberian peninsula as Iberia. According to prior historians used Iberia to mean the country "this side of the Iberos (the Ebro)" as far north as the Rhône, but in his day they set the Pyrenees as the limit. Polybius respected that limit, but identified Iberia as the Mediterranean side as far south as Gibraltar, with the Atlantic side having no name. Elsewhere he says that Saguntum is "on the seaward foot of the range of hills connecting Iberia and Celtiberia".
