The ancient Greeks reached the Iberian Peninsula, of which they had heard from the Phoenicians, by voyaging westward on the Mediterranean. Hecataeus of Miletus was the first known to use the term Iberia, which he wrote about c. 500 BCE. Herodotus of Halicarnassus says of the Phocaeans that "it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with the iberian peninsula as Iberia. According to prior historians used Iberia to mean the country "this side of the Iberos (the Ebro)" as far north as the Rhône, but in his day they set the Pyrenees as the limit. Polybius respected that limit, but identified Iberia as the Mediterranean side as far south as Gibraltar, with the Atlantic side having no name. Elsewhere he says that Saguntum is "on the seaward foot of the range of hills connecting Iberia and Celtiberia".
## Introduction
'Hackaton' combines the words ‘hacking’ and ‘marathon’ and is used in the sense of a competitive exploratory activity intended to solve specific challenges.
## Problem
During military operations, mission success can hinge on intelligence extracted from voice conversations. These communications must be transcribed to text for analysis; however, audio-recordings are rarely of studio-quality. This challenge is to create a Speech-to-Text (STT) system capable of accurately transcribing noisy communications. The system should be designed to overcome various types of noise pollution such as background noise, radio feedback and/or multiple speakers. We encourage the use of AI and other methods.
## Description
Iberian NST (IbNST) is a software application intended to help transcription from speech audio to text. To do this task, IbNST is augmented with some features like noise reduction, environmental noise digital discrimination and conversations selection by using machine learning (ML) models and natural language processors (NLP) models.
